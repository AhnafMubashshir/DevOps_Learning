## _Linux Basics_

This course is divided into three parts. In the first part, we cover the fundamentals of Linux operating systems.
In the second part, we cover some basic commands used in Linux like navigating the file system, viewing and manipulating files, I/O redirection etc.
In the third part, we cover Linux system administration. 

### Commands for Navigating the File System:

- ls  (list files and directories)
- pwd  (print working directory)
- cd  (change direcotry)


### Commands for Manipulating Files : 

- touch (create new file)
- mkdir (create new directories)
- rm (delete files and directories)
- cp (copy files and directories)
- mv (move files and directories) 
   Eg: mv <source_path> <destination_path>

### Commands for Viewing Files :
- cat (most simplest use to print the contents of the file on your output screen)
- head (displays the first 10 lines of the file by default)
- tail
- more (all)
- less

### Echo Command in Linux
 prints the given input string on the screen.

### Text Processing Commands
- grep (display all the lines in a file that contains a particular input)
 Eg:grep <word_to_search> <file_name>

- sed (used to replace a text in a file)
 Eg:sed 's/<text_to_replace>/<replacement_text>/' <file_name>

- sort 
 increasing order
 lexicographical order

### I/O Redirection
We can use some special operators to redirect the output of the command to files or even to the input of other commands.
  Eg: https://linkedin.github.io/school-of-sre/level101/linux_basics/images/linux/commands/image30.png
 
 ls > redirected file
